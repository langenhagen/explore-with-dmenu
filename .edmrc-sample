# rc file for explore-with-dmenu.sh
#
# This file is plain bash. It be sourced by explore-with-dmenu.sh after loading the defaults.
# This makes it possible to overwrite some or all of settings
#
# There are 4 configurable variables that `explore-with-dmenu.sh` takes into account,
# but changing only 2 of them, the array $choices and the string $open_terminal_command is
# sufficient in most cases

# the initial path explore-with-dmenu.sh uses, if not specified, defaults to $HOME
selected_path="$HOME"

# initial set of items shown at first
choices=(
    '<open terminal here>'              # add this special item to open a Shell at $selected_path
    '.'                                 # add this special item to open $selected_path in a Finder
    '..'                                # add this special item to traverse to the parent folder
    'path/to/some/often/used/folder'    # add subdolders of $selected_path like this
    'path/to/some/often/used/file.txt'  # add files in folders under $selected_path like this
    'my/music/library/'
    'my/music/library/my favorite song.mp3'
    "$(ls -t "$selected_path")"         # output of `ls -t` on the $selected_path
    )

# if the array $choices is not specified, it defaults to:
# choices=(
#     '<open terminal here>'
#     '.'
#     '..'
#     "$(ls "$selected_path")"
#     )

# the variable $open_command must store a command that will be executed with the chosen item is a
# file or the string '.';
# the command must handle can open files and folders and directory paths as arguments
open_command='xdg-open'

# the variable $open_terminal_command must store a command that will be executed with the chosen
# item is the string '<open terminal here>';
