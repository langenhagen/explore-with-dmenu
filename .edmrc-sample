# rc file for explore-with-dmenu.sh

# This file is plain bash. It be sourced by explore-with-dmenu.sh after loading the defaults.
# This makes it possible to overwrite some or all of settings

# There are 4 configurable variables that `explore-with-dmenu.sh` takes into account,
# but changing only 2 of them, the array ${choices} and the string ${open_terminal_command}
# is sufficient in most cases

# the initial path explore-with-dmenu.sh uses
# if not specified, defaults to ${HOME}
selected_path="${HOME}"

# initial set of items shown at first
choices=(
    '<open terminal here>'              # add this special item to open a Shell at ${selected_path}
    '.'                                 # add this special item to open ${selected_path} in a Finder
    '..'                                # add this special item to traverse to the parent folder
    'path/to/some/often/used/folder'    # add subdolders of $selected_path like this
    'path/to/some/often/used/file.txt'  # add files in folders under $selected_path like this
    'my/music/library/'
    'my/music/library/my favorite song.mp3'
    "$(ls -t ${selected_path})"         # Output of `ls -t` on the $selected_path
    )

# if the array ${choices} is not specified, it defaults to:
# choices=(
#     '<open terminal here>'
#     '.'
#     '..'
#     "$(ls "${selected_path}")"
#     )


# stores a command that can open files and folders;
# if not specified, defaults to `xdg-open` on Linux and `open` on Mac
open_command='xdg-open'

# stores a command that spawns a shell at the current directory;
# if not specified, defaults to `konsole --workdir`
