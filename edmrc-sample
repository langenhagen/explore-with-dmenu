# rc file for explore-with-dmenu.sh
#
# This file is plain bash. It is sourced by explore-with-dmenu.sh after it loaded the defaults.
# This makes it possible to overwrite some or all of settings.
#
# There are 6 configurable variables that `explore-with-dmenu.sh` takes into account,
# but changing only 2 of them, the array $choices and the string $open_terminal_command,
# should be sufficient in most cases.

# the initial path explore-with-dmenu.sh uses; if not specified, defaults to $HOME
selected_path="$HOME"

# the path the selection history will be stored; defaults to ${HOME}/.config/.edm_history"
history_file="${HOME}/.config/.edm_history"

# the maximum number of recent entries that will be retained in the history file; defaults to 3
max_history_entries=3

# initial set of items shown at first

    '..'                                # add this special item to traverse to the parent folder
    'path/to/some/often/used/folder'    # add subdolders of $selected_path like this

    "$(cat "$history_file")"            # recent entries from prior runs
)

# if the array $choices is not specified, it defaults to:

#     '<open terminal here>'
#     '.'
#     '..'
#     "$(ls "$selected_path")"
#     "$(cat "$history_file")"
